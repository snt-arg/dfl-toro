# Record a Demonstration <a id="record"></a>

To record a demonstration, use the following command:

```bash
roslaunch lfd_interface lfd_recorder.launch config:=fr3 name:=DEMO_NAME
```

**Note:** The demonstration name must not contain numbers or special characters such as underscores.

- When recording starts, the recorder will automatically ignore the initial part of the recording where the robot is stationary and has not yet moved (i.e., before the demonstration begins).
- During the recording, the recorded path will be visualized in real-time using RViz.

To stop the recording, press `Ctrl+C`. The demonstration will be saved under `lfd_interface/data/demonstrations/`.

## What is Recorded

The recorded data includes the joint states, their timings, and the end-effector pose throughout the demonstration, with a specified recording frequency.

## Configuration

The configuration file is located at `lfd_interface/config/demonstrations`. The configuration file for FR3 looks like this:

```yaml
robot_ns: "fr3"
planning_group: "fr3_arm"
base_frame: "fr3_link0"
ee_frame: "fr3_hand_tcp"
```

- **robot_ns**: Specifies the robot's namespace used for topics and services.
- **planning_group**: Defines the MoveIt planning group to be used during the demonstration.
- **base_frame**: The name of the link in the robot's URDF file that serves as the base frame.
- **ee_frame**: The name of the link in the robot's URDF file that serves as the end-effector frame, used for recording the end-effector pose throughout the demonstration.
