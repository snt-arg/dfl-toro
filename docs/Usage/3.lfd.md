# Learning from a Demonstration <a id="learn"></a>

To initiate the LfD process, use the following command:

```bash
roslaunch lfd_interface program_bundle.launch robot_group:=fr3
```

This command launches several components, including the IK solver server, the MoveIt utility node, and the DMP server, to perform the LfD process.

## Available Topics and Actions

The launched system exposes the following topics and actions:

- **`fr3/lfd_pipeline` Action Server**: Allows training on a specific demonstration and planning an LfD for a new goal configuration with a defined duration scale. It also provides options to visualize the resulting plan in RViz or directly execute it on the robot.

- **`fr3/plan_joint` and `fr3/plan_pose` Action Servers**: These servers use MoveIt's internal motion planning to plan and execute trajectories to reach a specified joint configuration or end-effector pose. The `fr3/plan_pose` server also requires an initial joint configuration for IK, considering null space in the case of redundant manipulators.

- **`fr3/pose_state` Topic**: Publishes the pose of the end-effector, similar to how the `joint_states` topic publishes joint positions.

The topics and actions provided allow for flexibility in LfD, including planning, visualization, and real-time execution, facilitating effective robot programming through demonstrations.
